# .net-runtime

**.NET Runtime** is the execution environment for .NET applications.  
It provides essential services such as:

- Memory management  
- Garbage collection  
- Type safety  
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation

The JIT compiler converts Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime, ensuring efficient execution on the target system.  

.NET Runtime also enables **cross-platform development**, allowing applications to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> Ideal for developers working with C#, F#, or VB.NET who need a reliable and efficient execution environment.
