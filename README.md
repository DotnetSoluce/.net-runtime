# .net-runtime
.NET Runtime is the execution environment for .NET applications. It provides essential services like memory management, garbage collection, and type safety. It also includes the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which converts intermediate language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime. The .NET Runtime enables cross-platform development.
